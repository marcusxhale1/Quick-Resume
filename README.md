<!-- This is just a readme
I was given the instructions on creating a resume. 

I built out the resume. 

Then I got stuck in a 30-50 min loop trying to connnect my github to my terminal so it's easier to push and I look like a legit software engineer. 

This was a bit of a struggle for me, but I figured it out. Moving on. 

Thanks! -->
